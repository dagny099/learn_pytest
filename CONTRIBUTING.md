## Project Philosophy

This project serves two main purposes:
1. Creating a useful workout analytics dashboard
2. Demonstrating good testing practices in Python

When contributing, please keep these goals in mind and remember that clear tests and documentation are as important as the code itself.

2. Create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Development Workflow

1. Write tests first! This project follows test-driven development principles.
2. Run the test suite frequently:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
3. Keep your code clean and well-documented.
4. Update documentation as needed.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of major changes.
2. Update the development journal with your learning insights.
3. Add tests for any new functionality.
4. Create a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes.
